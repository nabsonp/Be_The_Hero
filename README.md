# Be_The_Hero
Application developed with JavaScript, using Node.js for back-end, React.js for web front-end and React Native for mobile front-end. The goal is to create a platform where NGOs can register incidents that need investment so people can contact them and help.

## Running the Application
Before run the application you need to install all the dependencies with:
> npm install

Do that in all the three folders.
Now, to run the server you just have to run in the folder 'backend':
> npm start

To run the web app, run the same command in the folder 'frontend'.

You can see the mobile app running on your own cellphone installing Expo. After that, in the folder 'mobile' run:
> expo start

A window on your browser will open with a QR code. Use your cellphone's camera to open it and the app will run.

That's it. Now you can see may first application using JavaScript!
